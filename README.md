A safeolder application

## Description
You need to put some files into a safe-zone that only you can access? You have chosen the right application. 
*MyOlder* allows you to safe store files and use them when you need. You will set up an authenticated user,
the only one that will be authorized to access all the files. <br>
Every time you will open the application, you will need to insert all your credentials (username and password), <br>
and you will access to all your files. 

## Login
The login is meant to be secure and to protect all your files. It uses several levels of encryption to protect your credentials <br>
and also for protecting your files. If there are no credentials at the login time, you will be asked to create <br>
a new user via the *root-create-page*.

## Application appearance
MyOlder has only 1 theme for now. The dark one. The application has an home, shown after the login process, <br>
all the safe files will be listed there using a list view. To unlock a file and view it's content you have to <br>
simply tap on the card. To show informations about a specific file you can press on the info button. 
You can delete files by pressing on the red bin. <br> <br>
MyOlder has also a left drawer, where you can see informations about the logged user and perform some actions.
